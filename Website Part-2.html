    Pizza (Italian: [pittsa], Neapolitan: [pittsə]) is a savory dish of Italian origin consisting of a usually round,
    flattened base of leavened wheat-based dough topped with tomatoes, cheese, and often various other ingredients (such
    as anchovies, mushrooms, onions, olives, pineapple, meat, etc.), which is then baked at a high temperature,
    traditionally in a wood-fired oven.[1] A small pizza is sometimes called a pizzetta. A person who makes pizza is
    known as a pizzaiolo.
